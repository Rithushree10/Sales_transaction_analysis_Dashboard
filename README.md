# Sales_transaction_analysis_Dashboard
In this project, I analyzed sales transaction data to uncover key business trends and performance insights. The analysis involved identifying top-performing products, high-revenue regions, and patterns in customer purchase behavior. Using tools like Excel, Tableau, I cleaned and organized the data, performed in-depth analysis, and built interactive dashboards to visualize the results.
